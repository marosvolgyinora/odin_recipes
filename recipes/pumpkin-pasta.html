    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make the most of pumpkins this autumn. When puréed and combined with mascarpone and parmesan, their flesh transforms into a silky, delicious pasta sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>500g pumpkin or squash, peeled and cut into roughly 3cm cubes</li>
        <li>50-100ml whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mascarpone</li>
        <li>350g short pasta (rigatoni or penne work well)</li>
        <li>40g grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative, plus extra to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, shallow, flameproof casserole or frying pan over a low-medium heat and fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 10-15 mins until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and fry for 1 min more. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pumpkin in a pan of boiling salted water for 10-15 mins until tender when pierced with a cutlery knife. Drain and tip into a blender (or use a hand blender). Blitz with 50ml milk and the onions until completely smooth, gradually adding more milk until the mixture is thick enough to just coat the back of a spoon (you may not need all the milk). Tip into a large frying pan with the tomato purée and mascarpone, and bring to a simmer over a low heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling, salted water following pack instructions. Drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water. Toss the pasta with the pumpkin sauce, parmesan and 50-100ml of the reserved water to loosen. Season and scatter with extra parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
